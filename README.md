# cluster_names
Given a list of names, this program coverts each name to the American Sounxex equivalent and finds the Levenshtein distance between them. This matrix of distances is then used as an input to a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups similar names together. This was an assignment completed for an NLP class that was part of the MSAN program.
